## Coding style

1. 4 literal spaces for tab
1. curly braces live on their own line
1. after "while", "if", "for" etc. put a space
1. no space after opening parantheses and no space before closing parantheses
1. space before after most arithemtic related operations (e.g. "/", "+", "-", "+=")
    - Think about "reading" the code. "C equals A plus B" (i.e. C = A + B;)
1. but no space before after for other code operations
    - But no need to do "A ++;" just do "A++;" to increment
    - No need to do "classApointer -> func()", just do "classApointer->func()"
1. variable member names end with an underscore
1. names will follow "Twiki" style, where the words are concatenated with capitalization
    - Except for class names, all names are "frstLetterIsLowerThenUpperCase"
